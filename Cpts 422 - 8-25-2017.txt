Exhaustive testing

the specification -> black box testing
Unexpected functionality: cannot be revealed by black box techniques

the implementation -> white box testing
Missing functionality: cannot be revealed by white box techniques


Complete coverage: white box		// get to all the situation		x=4, y=3 | x=5, y=6
if x > y then
	Max := x;
else
	Max := x; 		// fault
end if;

					// We can not use the size of the test case to decide the coverage

Complete coverage: Black box
divide the input domain into the following classes and use one daya point from each class

Differetnces among testing levels:
unit testing
- from module specifications
- visibility of code details
- complex scaffolding
- behavior of single module

integration testing
- fromm interface spcifications
- visibility of integr. struct.
- some scaffolding
- interations among modules

system testing
- from requirements specs
- no visibility of code
- no drivers/stubs
- system functionsabilities

Regression testing: every other case are still working after unit testing and integration testing
