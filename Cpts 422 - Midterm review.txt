Theory: understand the concepts
	- multiple choice question: 50% answer, 50% justification
	- open/closed questions						// provide short answer
	
	- example: how testing fits into the ... development process models (waterfall, agile, etc)
	- example: what are the different code review policies
	
	- compare and contrast
		- Testing vs debugging vs quality assurance
		- black box testing vs white box testing

	- mc
		- (True v False v it depends) ^ justification

Practice: test what you know
	- How would you test it?
	- describe how you would perform TDD for method	...		// describe the general strategies that you are planning to follow and why

	- Perform TTD on method ...
	- Perform unit testing on ...					// comment on the code

Topic
- Testing
	- vocabulary: can have false in the code
	- goal: make sure have confidence to say its right
	- challenges: take times to test everything
	- types: unit testing, integration testing, whitebox, blackbox
	- levels: 
- The role of testing in the different process models
	- waterfall
	- agile
- Unit testing
	- characteristics: test one function at a time
	- cons: takes time to figure out what need to be test
- Integration testing
	- characteristics: unit work together
	- strategies: bottome up, top down, pair wise
- System testing (functional testing)
	- characteristics: 
	- types:
	- example
		- stress testing (how many people can take)
		- performance testing (how fast can it run)
		- usaibility testing (how easy can user use it)
- User testing
	- characteristics: 
	- exmaple
		- aphla/beta testing
- Code reviews
	- try to find problem
	- try to find solution
	- to get a better understand to the code
	- share code ownership
	- being aware of design pattern
	- challenges
		- take a while		// diffcult to communcate what had change
			- solution
				- talk in person
				- use tool
